## Summary

Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your presentation. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. The addin will ignore code chunks and only count the words in
prose. You can also load your data here and present any analysis results
/ plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only
the most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). And make
sure to hide your code with `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are
trying to make is about the code itself. Your results with proper output
and graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary
of your project.
